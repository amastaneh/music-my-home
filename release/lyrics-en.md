# Dawn of the Homeland (Sobhe Mihan)

## [Spoken Intro]

Rise — break free from night’s hard chain,  
Shatter the spell of shadow’s reign.

This is the end of all this black,  
The homeland’s dawn is breaking back.

Ignite the Simorgh’s wings on fire,  
Tear sorrow out from root and mire.

The white light waits beyond this ridge,  
Dawn, in the homeland’s blood, is writ.

## [Chorus / Song]

My land… my home…  
My house… O weary soil — my homeland…

My nest… my soul… my roots… my mother…

I am Iran,  
My mother — I am Iran,  
I am Iran.

---

## [Rap]

My nest… my soul… my roots… my mother… listen:

Our bones are crushed!  
Our fathers’ moans!  
Our youths’ screams!  
The lump in every throat — it chokes!  
The rubble of our grief!  
The darkness of our world!  
The tears that fill our nights!  
The dead — out in the streets!

---

## [Rap]

Enough of all this death,  
This tired earth is sick of war.  
Nights dancing with the lead,  
By morning — hymns of lies once more.

I am Iran.

---

## [Chorus / Repeat]

My nest… my soul… my roots… my mother…

I am Iran.

## [Spoken Outro / Repeat]

Rise — break free from night’s hard chain,  
Shatter the spell of shadow’s reign.

This is the end of all this black,  
The homeland’s dawn is breaking back.

Ignite the Simorgh’s wings on fire,  
Tear sorrow out from root and mire.

The white light waits beyond this ridge,  
Dawn, in the homeland’s blood, is writ.
