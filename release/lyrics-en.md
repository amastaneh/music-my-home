# Homeland’s Dawn (Morning of the Homeland - صبح میهن)

## [Spoken Intro]

Rise from the grip of night,  
Break the spell of deep darkness.

This is the end of the long night,  
The dawn of the homeland begins.

Burn a feather of the Simorgh,  
Uproot suffering from its very core.

Pure light rises behind the mountain,  
In the blood-red dawn of the homeland.

## [Chorus / Song]

My land… my home…  
My house… O weary soil — my homeland…

My nest… my soul… my roots… my mother…

My Iran,  
My Mother — My Iran,  
My Iran.

---

## [Rap]

My nest… my soul… my roots… my mother… listen:

Our bones are crushed!  
Our fathers’ moans!  
Our youths’ screams!  
The lump in every throat — it chokes!  
The rubble of our grief!  
The darkness of our world!  
The tears that fill our nights!  
The dead — out in the streets!

---

## [Rap]

Enough, all this death is too much.  
This soil is worn out by war.
Nights dancing with lead bullets,
By dawn, the anthem of deception.

My Iran.

---

## [Chorus / Repeat]

My nest… my soul… my roots… my mother…

My Iran.

## [Spoken Outro / Repeat]

Rise from the grip of night,  
Break the spell of deep darkness.

This is the end of the long night,  
The dawn of the homeland begins.

Burn a feather of the Simorgh,  
Uproot suffering from its very core.

Pure light rises behind the mountain,  
In the blood-red dawn of the homeland.
